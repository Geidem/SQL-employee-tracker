## Description

SQL Employee Tracker: This is an SQL employee database that easily allows users to navigate through different departments and roles of employees through simple command-line prompts. This project allowed me to sharpen my knowledge of SQL databases and using javascript to interactively add information to save to created databases with a smooth, user friendly application. Shout out to inquirer as well to allow this application to run in the command line and allow me to make use of prompts to streamline everything.
